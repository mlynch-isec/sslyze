# Name:         SSLyzeSSLConnection.py
# Purpose:      Helper class for SSL connections - very specific to SSLyze. 
#               It takes care of all the things SSLyze plugins rely on when 
#               performing an SSL connection, such as properly configuring 
#               SSL_CTX from looking at the shared_settings object.
#               The goal was to put everything related to SSLyze in one spot
#               and keep the rest of the SSL code generic.
